Problem Statement
You are given an integer 
N
.

Find a triple of positive integers 
h
, 
n
 and 
w
 such that 
4/N = 1/h + 1/n + 1/w
.

If there are multiple solutions, any of them will be accepted.

Constraints

It is guaranteed that, for the given integer 
N
, there exists a solution such that 
h,n,w \leq 3500
.

Inputs
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

Outputs
Print a triple of positive integers 
h
, 
n
 and 
w
 that satisfies the condition, in the following format:

h

n

w

Sample Input 1
2

Sample Output 1
1 2 2

4/2 = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/2
.

Sample Input 2
3485

Sample Output 2
872 1012974 1539173474040

It is allowed to use an integer exceeding 
3500
 in a solution.

Sample Input 3
4664

Sample Output 3
3498 3498 3498
