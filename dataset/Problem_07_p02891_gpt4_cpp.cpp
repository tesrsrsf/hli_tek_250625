Problem Statement
Given is a string 
S
. Let 
T
 be the concatenation of 
K
 copies of 
S
.
We can repeatedly perform the following operation: choose a character in 
T
 and replace it with a different character.
Find the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the following condition: any two adjacent characters in 
T
 are different.

Constraints

1 \leq |S| \leq 100

S
 consists of lowercase English letters.

1 \leq K \leq 10^9

K
 is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

S

K

Output
Print the minimum number of operations required.

Sample Input 1
issii
2

Sample Output 1
4

T
 is 
issiiissii
.  For example, we can rewrite it into 
ispiqisyhi
, and now any two adjacent characters are different.

Sample Input 2
qq
81

Sample Output 2
81

Sample Input 3
cooooooooonteeeeeeeeeest
999993333

Sample Output 3
8999939997
