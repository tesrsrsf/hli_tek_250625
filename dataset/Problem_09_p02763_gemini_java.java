Problem Statement
You are given a string 
S
 of length 
N
 consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process 
Q
 queries of the following two types:

Type 
1
: change the 
i_q
-th character of 
S
 to 
c_q
. (Do nothing if the 
i_q
-th character is already 
c_q
.)

Type 
2
: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of 
S
 between the 
l_q
-th and 
r_q
-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

N
, 
Q
, 
i_q
, 
l_q
, and 
r_q
 are integers.

S
 is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

c_q
 is a lowercase English letter.

1 \leq N \leq 500000

1 \leq Q \leq 20000

|S| = N

1 \leq i_q \leq N

1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N

There is at least one query of type 
2
 in each testcase.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

S

Q

Query_1

\vdots

Query_Q

Here, 
Query_i
 in the 
4
-th through 
(Q+3)
-th lines is one of the following:

1

i_q

c_q

2

l_q

r_q

Output
For each query of type 
2
, print a line containing the answer.

Sample Input 1
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7

Sample Output 1
3
1
5

In the first query, 
cdbb
 contains three kinds of letters: 
b
 , 
c
 , and 
d
, so we print 
3
.

In the second query, 
S
 is modified to 
abcdzbd
.

In the third query, 
a
 contains one kind of letter: 
a
, so we print 
1
.

In the fourth query, 
S
 is modified to 
abcazbd
.

In the fifth query, 
S
 does not change and is still 
abcazbd
.

In the sixth query, 
abcazbd
 contains five kinds of letters: 
a
, 
b
, 
c
, 
d
, and 
z
, so we print 
5
.
