Problem Statement
Takahashi has decided to give a string to his mother.

The 
value
 of a string 
T
 is the length of the longest common subsequence of 
T
 and 
T'
, where 
T'
 is the string obtained by reversing 
T
.
That is, the value is the longest length of the following two strings that are equal: a subsequence of 
T
 (possibly non-contiguous), and a subsequence of 
T'
 (possibly non-contiguous).

Takahashi has a string 
S
. He wants to give her mother a string of the highest possible value, so he would like to change at most 
K
 characters in 
S
 to any other characters in order to obtain a string of the highest possible value.
Find the highest possible value achievable.

Constraints

1 \leq |S| \leq 300

0 \leq K \leq |S|

S
 consists of lowercase English letters.

K
 is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

S

K

Output
Print the highest possible value achievable.

Sample Input 1
abcabcabc
1

Sample Output 1
7

Changing the first character to 
c
 results in 
cbcabcabc
.
Let this tring be 
T
, then one longest common subsequence of 
T
 and 
T'
 is 
cbabcbc
, whose length is 
7
.

Sample Input 2
atcodergrandcontest
3

Sample Output 2
15
