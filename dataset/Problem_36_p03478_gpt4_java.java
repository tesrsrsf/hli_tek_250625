Problem Statement
Find the sum of the integers between 
1
 and 
N
 (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 
10
 is between 
A
 and 
B
 (inclusive).

Constraints

1 \leq N \leq 10^4

1 \leq A \leq B \leq 36

All input values are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

A

B

Output
Print the sum of the integers between 
1
 and 
N
 (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 
10
 is between 
A
 and 
B
 (inclusive).

Sample Input 1
20 2 5

Sample Output 1
84

Among the integers not greater than 
20
, the ones whose sums of digits are between 
2
 and 
5
, are: 
2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14
 and 
20
. We should print the sum of these, 
84
.

Sample Input 2
10 1 2

Sample Output 2
13

Sample Input 3
100 4 16

Sample Output 3
4554
