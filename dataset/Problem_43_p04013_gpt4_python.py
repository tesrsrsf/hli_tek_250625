Problem Statement
Tak has 
N
 cards. On the 
i
-th 
(1 \leq i \leq N)
 card is written an integer 
x_i
.
He is selecting one or more cards from these 
N
 cards, so that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly 
A
.
In how many ways can he make his selection?

Constraints

1 \leq N \leq 50

1 \leq A \leq 50

1 \leq x_i \leq 50

N,\,A,\,x_i
 are integers.

Partial Score

200
 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying 
1 \leq N \leq 16
.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N

A

x_1

x_2

...

x_N

Output
Print the number of ways to select cards such that the average of the written integers is exactly 
A
.

Sample Input 1

The following are the 
5
 ways to select cards such that the average is 
8
:

Select the 
3
-rd card.

Select the 
1
-st and 
2
-nd cards.

Select the 
1
-st and 
4
-th cards.

Select the 
1
-st, 
2
-nd and 
3
-rd cards.
